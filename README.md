<h1>Luke&Jakob Guitars Website</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This Website was supposed to be for the guitar company Luke&Jakob Guitars (now Apollon Guitars https://apollonguitars.de).
  After one year of great service it is now taken down, as it is very time consuming to add / improve features.
</p>
<h2>How to get started</h2>
<p>
  Download the repo and run main.py<br>
  For some features you need to set environment variables (look into the config.py), you can do this 
  <ol>
    <li>typing everytime into the shell >set variableName="variableValue"<</li>
    <li>creating a file called ".env" and writing >variableName="variableValue"<</li>
  </ol>
